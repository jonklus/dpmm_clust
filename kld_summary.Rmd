```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


$$
D_{KL}(p||q) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}}p(x)log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right)
$$

for densities $p$ and $q$ with support $\mathcal{X}$, where $p$ is the estimated density and $q$ is the true density. 

## Well separated case

```{r}
wellsep_kld = readRDS("../MCMC_Runs/kld_summary_sep_02_08_2024.rds")
knitr::kable(x = wellsep_kld, digits = 3, 
             caption = "KL divergence averaged across 10 simulated data sets for the 
             well-separated case with n=30 observations")
```

## Close together case

```{r}
close_kld = readRDS("../MCMC_Runs/kld_summary_close_02_08_2024.rds")
knitr::kable(x = close_kld, digits = 3, 
             caption = "KL divergence averaged across 10 simulated data sets for the 
             closer case with n=30 observations")
```
